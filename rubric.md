# Kin Community Rewards 
#### (Maintained by Kin Council)

Working together to succeed together - that is the philosophy behind Kin. Recognizing Kin's belief in a more fair digital world, where everyone is rewarded for the value they create online, the Kin Community Council has proposed a way to reward contributions to the Kin Ecosystem of all shapes and sizes. Over time, the Council intends to work with the community to perfect this rubric.

#### Scoring Rubric
`Payout (in Kin) = Score / Sum of all Scores * Total Budget`</br>

The criteria are meant to reflect the following:

- Creativity - New and unfulfilled needs of the ecosystem. This criterion aims to capture the initiative and ingenuity of a contribution, incentivizing experimentation and innovation. (Scale 1–4)

- Quality - Quality of work. This criterion aims to capture the quality of work and attention to detail put into a contribution, lending favoritism to quality over quantity. (Scale 1–4)

- Resources - Estimated required resources (time + money + acquired skill set). This criterion aims to quantify the level of investment committed to creating and publishing a contribution. (Scale 1–4)

- Impact - Projected net impact to the ecosystem. This criterion aims to incentivize beneficial contributions to the ecosystem. It represents the largest category by far. (Scale 1–13)

Entries are judged by 4 Kin Council members in order to attain aggregated scores of up to a maximum of 100 per entry. These scores are then used to determine the share each contributor gets of the payout.

Note that Council members may submit entries, but if they do, they cannot participate in scoring.
